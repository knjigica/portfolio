# Theme

This is an (slightly updated by myself) simple monospaced resume theme for Hugo created by Olivier Roques. It was ported from Jekyll theme
[ankitsultana/researcher](https://github.com/ankitsultana/researcher).

## Installation
This theme uses Sass to generate CSS files so make sure you have the
*extended* Hugo version installed.

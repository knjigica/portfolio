Hey there! I'm a Argentinian-Slovenian journalist, currently based in [Gdynia, Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gdynia).

I tend to report on stories about migrations, Slovenian diasporas & other minorities, LGBT+ issues, and current affairs of the country I'm around at the time (Slovenia, Russia, Germany, and now, Poland). Sometimes, business.

I'm a Russian Studies graduate and I'm interested in exploring anything related to the post-Soviet space. 

Apart from that, I'm a linguistics nerd who speaks Slovene, Spanish, English, Russian, German, intermediate Polish & basic Brazilian Portuguese. 

I'm interested in languages in general, also the more techie ones. I've set up this website, built a little bot for Twitter [@womeninscienc11](https://twitter.com/womeninscienc11) and wrote some code to automate a bunch of Russia-related news digests called [Чё там?](https://cho-tam.blogspot.com/)

Mostly, however, I write in Slovene & English.

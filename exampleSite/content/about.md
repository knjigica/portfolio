Argentinian-Slovenian journalist, polyglot & Russian studies graduate. Currently based in Gdynia, Poland. For some reason, I always end up writing stuff, fiction, non-fiction, or scripts for documentary films. 

I tend to report on stories about migrations, Slovenian diasporas & minorities in general, LGBT+ issues, and current affairs of the country I'm located at the moment. Sometimes, business.

I'm a Russian Studies graduate and I'm all into post-Soviet. 

Mostly, I write in Slovene & English.
